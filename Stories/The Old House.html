Comrade (upperfirst: $animal) seems to have sunken most of their inheritance in buying a sky ship to fulfill their dream of becoming a sky pirate, but finds the challenges of aerial brigandry to be less glamorous than they imagined after their crew mutinies several skymiles outside their port of departure.

Before long, your parents come out of their bedroom and give a surprised thank you for your attempt to make a morning meal.

Clad in robes and mumbling something about caffeine, two slouching humans drift past you from the direction of the room your parents sleep in. You turn the volume down a little, even though this is a really good part near the end of the episode.

//&quot;Can you turn that off? Those shrill voices give me a headache.&quot;//

Not a question, but a demand in the garb of a question. This is getting to the really good part, but you make a mental note that there&#39;ll be reruns all week.
